Swimming is a sport, not just any sport but an extraordinary sport. You might not agree with this, it is just an opinion, but I have tons of proof about why swimming is very fascinating, a very healthy sport, and something you should consider trying. If you don't want to do competitive swimming, then you can always go to your local pool in the summer and swim for fun. In swimming there are 4 strokes; butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle. My favorite stroke is backstroke. If you want to learn how to do those 4 stroke, then simply watch the video listed above. Swimming isn't just strokes and swimming for fun. You can be a very competitive swimmer. For example, Michael Phelps is super competitive. He was in the olympics for swimming many times. The first time he was in the olympics was when he was only 15 years old! Michael Phelps has made many swimming records. There are also lots of interesting facts about swimming. A few facts are that freediver can hold there breath for 10 minutes.
