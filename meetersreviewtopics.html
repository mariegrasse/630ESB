		<p> why the bruins should get rid of zdeno chara as captain 
Lets start at the top HE ONLY HAD 14 POINTS!!!!! and he is on the first defensive pair and he is super old and they have alot talent besides him like patrice bergeron david panastrakt brandon marchand and charlie mcavoy</p>
lets compare him to some other defensemen like torey krug he had 53 points he has been on a downfall latley</p>
