		<h1> why dogs are better than cats. </h1>
		<p> Dogs can protect you its not cats nature to protect your home or you. most cats likely to run away and hide when faced trouble but dogs stand up and dont run away and hide.if strangers come and try to take stuff dogs will warn their owners and cat will just keep laying down and not care. For cats your have to spend a lot more money for different thing for example litter boxes.dogs are smarter dogs are more athletic and biger and they are always fun to be with even if you are sad and cats just worry about thereself but dogs worry about everybody.</p>
